## 2024-05-22 - Polymorphic N+1 Optimization
**Learning:** Polymorphic relationships in EF Core (using `EntityId` and `EntityType`) prevent standard `Include` navigation, leading to manual N+1 loading patterns in controllers.
**Action:** Use a two-step loading process: 1) Fetch the lightweight polymorphic entities (e.g., Relationships), 2) Collect IDs and fetch the related entities in a single batch query using `Contains`, then map them in memory.

## 2024-05-22 - SQL Parameter Limit
**Learning:** Using `Contains` with large lists (>2100 items) in EF Core causes SQL parameter limit exceptions (or performance degradation).
**Action:** When filtering by a large list of IDs, consider fetching a broader set (e.g., all relevant entities) and filtering in memory, especially if the broader set size is comparable to the requested set.
