## 2024-04-08 - Adding aria-hidden to decorative icons
**Learning:** Bootstrap Icons (and other purely decorative icon tags) inside wrappers that already convey their meaning (like a span with a title attribute) are read redundantly by screen readers unless hidden.
**Action:** When adding decorative visual elements like `<i class="bi ...">` inside elements that already contain text or tooltips explaining the intent, always add `aria-hidden="true"` to prevent screen readers from announcing redundant content.
## 2025-04-15 - Unlabelled Links from Decorative Images
**Learning:** Anchor tags (`<a>`) that wrap decorative images with `alt=""` and contain no actual text content are completely invisible to screen readers, resulting in unlabelled links.
**Action:** When adding anchor tags that only contain an image, verify that if the image has `alt=""`, the parent `<a>` tag has an explicit `aria-label` describing the destination.
